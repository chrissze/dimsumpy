What is dimsumpy?
--------------------
dimsumpy is a required helper library for pizzapy program, built by Chris Sze. 

This library required additional 3rd party libraries such as PySide6. 

This library has small functions across different categories, each is a small piece of code, just like Cantonese Dimsum dishes,  so this library is named dimsumpy.

dimsumpy's code can be used in projects other than pizzapy, so I made it a separate library.
